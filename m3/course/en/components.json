That purpose has value - and through these products we are seeking to realise that value. However, just as there are deliberate benefits we seek, there lurk risks of unintended consequences.</p><p>Data ethics plays a pivotal role in navigating this delicate balance. By adhering to ethical principles, we can mitigate these unforeseen risks and ensure that data is used in a manner consistent with societal norms and values. This not only safeguards individuals and communities from potential harm but also reinforces trust. When users and stakeholders perceive that data is being managed with integrity and respect, they are more likely to engage with and endorse the products and services on offer. In essence, data ethics becomes a cornerstone for fostering trust. By transparently addressing concerns and demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices, organisations can build stronger, trust-based relationships with their customers, enhancing both their reputation and the overall effectiveness of their data centric endeavours.</p>",

In the video, a white man and a dark-skinned black man both try to get soap from a soap dispenser. The soap dispenses for the white man, but not the darker skinned man.\n\nThis video of the incident went viral, raising concerns about potential racial bias in technology. The lack of diversity in the training data is pointed out as a possible cause of the biassed outcome, emphasising the importance of using inclusive data sets for AI technology development.\n\nThe incident has sparked discussions on racial discrimination in AI algorithms and has amplified calls for greater awareness and responsibility in developing AI systems to avoid unintentional discrimination. Overall, it serves as a reminder of the need for ethical and diverse testing approaches to ensure fairness in AI technologies.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817030963?h=b9ef979956&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"why is data ethics important\"></iframe>\n\nWhile soap dispensers are a more light-hearted example, this same problem has been documented in wearable fitness trackers and heart-rate monitors, and also in medical applications.",

For instance, if Melanoma is diagnosed early, an individual has a 100% chance of surviving over 1 year. However, this drops to 53% if diagnosed at a later stage. Notably, people with non-white skin, though less prone to skin cancer, exhibit lower 5-year survival rates (70%) compared to white individuals (92%) [1].\n\nThis highlights issues within our healthcare systems, but also an issue for those organisations who are developing technologies that utilise machine learning to support diagnosis. The video below explores this example in more depth and introduces the First Derm [2] dataset as an example.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817240774?h=1cdc6f2d90&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"why is data ethics important\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Broadly, there are two proposed approaches to mitigating this bias:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Increasing the variety of the data to build a more representative dataset</li>\r\n<li>Train a different system on a dataset of 90% non-white images to maintain higher accuracy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Both approaches require different considerations for the creation and use of data, and whilst both have merit as approaches to mitigation there are still further considerations to be taken into account to address future challenges.</p>\r\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\r\n<p>It is not just non-white people who are excluded from medical research.

In their study, Wu and Zhang delved into using machine learning to identify facial traits linked to \"criminality.\" They asserted that their algorithms could accurately differentiate between criminals and non-criminals using basic headshot images.</p>\r\n<p>Wu and Zhang&rsquo;s claim?</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Unlike a human examiner/judge, a computer vision algorithm or classifier has absolutely no subjective baggages [sic], having no emotions, no biases whatsoever due to past experience, race, religion, political doctrine, gender, age, etc., no mental fatigue, no preconditioning of a bad sleep or meal. The automated inference on criminality eliminates the variable meta-accuracy (the competence of the human judge/examiner) all together&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In short, they stated that the computer is entirely objective. Do you agree? Let&rsquo;s explore this idea in more detail:</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817271706?h=ff16aca3bd&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" title=\"Data Ethics - Criminal Faces\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Machines have been proven over and over to emphasise bias, not decrease it. The one thing machines are good at is consistency. So they will be concisely biassed and don&rsquo;t flit about like humans are prone to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Biases in images and image recognition systems result from how these systems have been trained. Understanding this history of image recognition training data can go a long way to tell us why newer systems are showing biases. If your dataset contains images of people smiling (the non-criminals) and those who aren&rsquo;t (the criminals), you do exactly what Wu and Zhang did - you build a smile detector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n<p>Wu, X., &amp; Zhang, X.
