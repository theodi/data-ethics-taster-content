<h1>Asking the right questions?</h1>
[below is the body of the component]
<p>As we&rsquo;ve explored, there are different considerations to be made across each stage of the data lifecycle. Regardless of the stage you are working at, when doing an ethical evaluation it is always important to ask the opposite question in order to provide balance. Such questions can also provide greater clarity on the ethical consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if you can match the following questions to their opposites</p>
[below p tag is the title of the second item object in the items array i.e. items[1].title]
<p>Who should we include in an ethical discussion about our project?</p>
[below GOES IN THE FIRST ITEM OBJECT IN THE ITEMS ARRAY i.e. items[1].options[i].text]
<ul>
<li><strong>Who should we exclude?</strong></li>
<li>Who should we invite?</li>
<li>Who should we consider?</li>
</ul>
[below p tag is the title of the second item object in the items array i.e. items[1].title]
<p>What are the risks of sharing data?</p>
[below GOES IN THE SECOND ITEM OBJECT IN THE ITEMS ARRAY i.e. items[1].options[i].text]
<ul>
<li><strong>What are the risks of not sharing data?</strong></li>
<li>What commercial agreements will reduce risks?</li>
<li>What checks are needed prior to sharing that reduce risks?</li>
</ul>
The rest of the items p tags account for the feedback. split the first p tag where the / is and then join the remaining p tags to each other with a space in between putting the one that starts with 'that's right!' in the feedback.correct property and the one that starts with 'are you sure about that?' in the feedback._incorrect.final property
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s right!/Are you sure about that?</strong></p>
<p>These are two of the questions that people battle with most commonly when taking a closed approach to a data ethics challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Open Data Institute, we get asked a lot about who should be included in a data ethics workshop or other discussion. The answer to below question is always the same. Who are you going to exclude? below doesn&rsquo;t mean we need everyone from an organisation, but it does force you to think carefully about inclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same is true around data sharing practices. Many evaluate the risks associated with data becoming more open on our data spectrum. However, there are also ethical implications in choosing not to share data. Why not start with the opposite question and assume the data will be openly available and justify either legally or ethically why it shouldn&rsquo;t be. below is also known as the &ldquo;open by default&rdquo; approach.</p>
