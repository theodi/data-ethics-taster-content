These questions encourage diverse stakeholder input for comprehensive impact mapping.</p><p>After categorising consequences as actionable, influential, or monitorable, roles and responsibilities are assigned for implementation.</p><p>Importantly, the process acknowledges that recommendations and actions may not always guarantee positive outcomes, requiring a balance between risk and change efforts.
